A list of all the things you shouldn't do as an Engineer/Technical Specialist

In the style of [Skippy's List](http://skippyslist.com/list/), feel free to contribute all the bad ideas/decisions that led to chaos in your IT Department/Engineering Team/Technical organization.

## Ground Rules
1. Keep it simple.
2. No names of people or companies. Keep it anonymous. 
3. Only things you have participated in or witnessed first-hand.
4. If you get a laugh, share the list with someone who could use one.
