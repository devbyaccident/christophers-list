# christophers-list
A list of all the things you shouldn't do in IT. Be it as an Engineer/Technical Specialist, Manager, Officer/Executive, or other!

In the style of [Skippy's List](http://skippyslist.com/list/), feel free to contribute all the bad ideas/decisions that led to chaos in your IT Department/Engineering Team/Technical organization/Company.

## Ground Rules
1. Keep it simple.
1. No names of people or companies. Keep it anonymous. 
1. Only things you have participated in or witnessed first-hand.
1. Try to place your item appropriately in the list so that the worst things (greatest impact, visibility, 'resume generating', etc.) are near the top (entry 1). 
1. If you get a laugh, share the list with someone who could use one.
